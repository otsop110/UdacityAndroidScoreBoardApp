# UdacityAndroidScoreBoardApp
Project for Udacity Android Development for Beginners course.
## Tennis score counter app
This app allows you to keep score for tennis. The points and games are shown in columns for each player A and B. The score can be reset with the reset button.
## Project requirements
* Layout: App is divided into two columns, one for each team. Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team. Each column contains buttons which track scoring. The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
* Functionality: The code runs without errors: score buttons update the score TextView in its column by adding the correct number of points. 	
The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.
*The code is readable and follows the best practices, text sizes are defined in sp, lengths are defined in dp and
padding and margin is used appropriately.
